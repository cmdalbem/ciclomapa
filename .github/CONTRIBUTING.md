# Contribution Guide

We're using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cmdalbem/ciclomapa/issues) for our backlog. Feel free to take a look around and chose the task you want. Use the tags at your advantage:

- `complexity` tags tell you how difficult a task *probably* is.
- `good first issue` is the perfect place to start if you're new to the project, or to coding itself.
- `help wanted` are issues where external help is currently more needed.

After you've chosen your task, you have no doubts on it and you're ready to start coding, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m '<commit_message>'`
4. Push to the original branch: `git push origin <project_name>/<location>`
5. Create the pull request.

Alternatively see the GitHub documentation on [creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
